# Help Desk Ticket Management System

This application is a basic "help desk" / support system ticket management system. End users can submit support ticket requests on the main page, and support staff can manage these tickets through a backend admin panel.

## Features

- **Ticket Submission**: Users can submit tickets with their name, email, and a description of their issue.
- **Ticket Management**: Support staff can view a summary of all tickets, including their status, and can drill down into each ticket to respond and update the status.
- **Status Updates**: Tickets can have one of the following statuses: "new", "in progress", or "resolved".
